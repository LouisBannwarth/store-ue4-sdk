The SDK makes it easier to integrate Xsolla products into your Unreal Engine project by providing out-of-the-box data structures and methods for working with Xsolla API.

After integration, you can use:

* [Login](https://developers.xsolla.com/doc/login/) to authenticate users and manage the friend system and user account
* [In-Game Store](https://developers.xsolla.com/doc/in-game-store/) for managing in-game purchases and player inventory in your application.
* [Pay Station](https://developers.xsolla.com/doc/pay-station/) for setting up payments.
* [Subscriptions](https://developers.xsolla.com/doc/subscriptions/) to provide users with access to a package of services under specified conditions (subscription cost and duration).

## Usage

To send requests to Xsolla servers and receive responses, the SDK provides the `XsollaStoreSubsystem`, `XsollaLoginSubsystem`, and `XsollaInventorySubsystem` classes. If you want to implement your own logic for buying items or inventory management, and don’t want to write boilerplate code for API calls, these classes are a good place to start.

Follow the [step-by-step tutorials](https://developers.xsolla.com/sdk/unreal-engine/integrate-complete-solution/integrate-on-app-side/) to get started with basic SDK features.
